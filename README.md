## Exercise 1

Copenhagen has a strategy for improving the living conditions in socially exposed areas (udsatte områder). It a policy which both addresses the social aspects for the people living there, and the physical conditions.

This exercises addresses the physical conditions, through the following two questions:

- How many parks are located in exposed areas?
- How many trees are located in exposed areas?

The Copenhagen data is in Danish, so here is a brief word/search list:

- exposed areas (udsatte byomraader)
- trees along roads (gadetræer/gadetraer)
- parks (parkregister)

## Exercise 2

Copenhagen prides itself for its lively bike culture. There are a number of different data on bike and bike services. But in particular, bikes do not mix well with trucks.

- How many bike racks are places along routes for heavy traffic?

Again, to help navigate the danish table names:

- bike rack (cykelstativ)
- heavy traffic (tungvogn)
